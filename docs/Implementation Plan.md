Here’s the updated 🧩 Modular Implementation Plan – AI Attendance System (with MediaPipe):

Phase 1: Core Setup & Face Registration

Day 1: Project Setup

Create GitHub repo → add README.md with project idea + plan.

Setup Python virtual environment.

Install dependencies:

pip install opencv-python mediapipe deepface numpy pandas streamlit plotly


Create folder structure:

ai_attendance/
├── data/          # Face embeddings, attendance CSV
├── modules/       # Core Python modules
├── dashboard/     # Streamlit app
├── demos/         # Demo videos/screenshots
├── main.py        # Entry point
└── README.md


Day 2: Face Registration (Selfie Capture)

Script to take webcam snapshot OR allow image upload.

Store registration selfies in /data/faces/.

Extract embeddings (DeepFace MobileNet) → store in faces.json / faces.csv.

Test by registering 2–3 users.

Day 3: Embedding Database

Create module modules/face_db.py:

register_user(name, image) → stores embedding + metadata.

load_embeddings() → loads stored embeddings into memory.

Verify embeddings load correctly.

Phase 2: Recognition + Liveness

Day 4: Face Recognition (Basic)

Implement recognize_user(frame) using DeepFace.

Match with stored embeddings → return name + confidence score.

Print results in terminal for testing.

Day 5: Live Video Recognition

Capture webcam feed with OpenCV.

Detect & recognize faces frame by frame.

Display recognition result live on screen (bounding boxes + names).

Day 6: Blink Detection (with MediaPipe)

Use MediaPipe Face Mesh → 468 facial landmarks.

Identify eye landmarks.

Compute Eye Aspect Ratio (EAR) or directly track eye openness from landmarks.

Detect blink events.

Print "Blink detected" when eyes close → open.

Day 7: Liveness Integration

Combine recognition + blink detection.

User is marked “Verified Live” only if:

Face recognized.

Blink detected within session.

Phase 3: Attendance Logging

Day 8: Attendance Logging (CSV)

Create attendance.csv with columns:
Name, ID, Date, Time, Status, Confidence, Liveness Verified

Logging function → writes entry only once per day per user.

Day 9: Confidence & Transparency

Include DeepFace confidence score in CSV.

Print live confirmation (e.g., ✅ Alice logged at 10:32 AM).

Phase 4: Dashboard Development

Day 10: Basic Dashboard Skeleton

Build Streamlit app with sidebar menu:

Dashboard

Attendance Logs

Analytics

Register User

Day 11: Attendance Table View

Load attendance.csv in dashboard.

Add filters (date, user, status).

Show emoji markers (✅, ❌).

Day 12: Analytics View

Use Plotly to show:

Attendance % chart.

Late arrivals stats.

Weekly/monthly summary.

Day 13: User Registration Page

Streamlit form → upload image + name.

Save selfie + generate embedding.

Update faces.json live.

Day 14: Gamified Features

Add emoji badges (🏆 100% attendance, 🌙 Late comer).

Add timeline chart → when users arrived each day.

Phase 5: Deployment & Demo

Day 15: Local Demo Video

Run full system (recognition + liveness + logging).

Record short demo video.

Save in /demos/demo.mp4.

Day 16: Streamlit Cloud Deployment

Deploy dashboard (analytics + logs + registration).

Since webcam won’t work in cloud → allow video upload for demo processing.

Link GitHub repo + Streamlit Cloud in README.md.

✅ Final Deliverables after 16 days:

Full working local attendance system (with MediaPipe-based liveness check).

Streamlit dashboard hosted on cloud.

Demo video in repo → recruiter-friendly project.

⚡ Key Change vs Old Plan:

Dlib → MediaPipe for landmarks & liveness (lighter, faster, modern).

No CMake hassles.

System runs smoother on CPU-only laptops.
